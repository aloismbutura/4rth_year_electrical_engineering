This repository contains files used for simulation and Numerical computation by Alois Mbutura for the electrical engineering units to aid visualisation. Majority of the code is written in python and the plots use **Scipy(scientific python)**, **numpy(numerical python)** and a plotting package for python known as **matplotlib**. Just proves you dont have to use matlab :P. Each code has the above package versions used as on my system. You can use pip to install and/or upgrade them. Google that :)
